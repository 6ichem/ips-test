## Project Documentation
### Getting Started
Welcome to my Laravel project! Before you can run the application, there are a few initial steps you need to follow to set up the database with some essential data. I improvised a little to implement a fully functional demo that includes all of the requirements and some more features (as requested <a href="https://ipsmedia.notion.site/ipsmedia/Back-end-Developer-Test-26cb7ae808204668a6ca3c408eaa6d4f">here</a>)

### Database Seeding
Before you can run the application, you need to seed the database with some initial data. Run the following commands to populate the database:
- Seed the default data:
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```
- Seed the Achievement data:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=AchievementSeeder
```
- Seed the Badge data:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=BadgeSeeder
```

### Running the Application
```bash
php artisan serve
```
The application will be available at http://localhost:8000 by default. You can access it in your web browser.

## Controllers Documentation
### AchievementsController
- The AchievementsController is responsible for retrieving a user's achievements and related data. It fetches information such as the user's unlocked achievements, the next available achievements to unlock, the user's current badge (if any), the name of the next badge, and calculates the remaining achievements needed to unlock the next badge.

### CommentController
- The CommentController handles the creation of comments. Users can submit comments with a specified body text, and the controller ensures that the comment is associated with the currently authenticated user. It also triggers an event (CommentWritten) when a comment is successfully created.

### LessonController
- The LessonController allows users to mark a lesson as watched. If a lesson is not already marked as watched by the user, it attaches the lesson to the user's watched lessons list. Additionally, it dispatches an event (LessonWatched) to capture information about the lesson being watched by the user.

### UserController
- The UserController primarily deals with user authentication and profile management. It provides the following functionality:
    - ``get``: Retrieves the authenticated user's profile.
    - ``register``: Allows new users to register by providing their name, email, and password. It assigns a default badge to the user during registration.
    - ``login``: Handles user login by validating email and password and returning an authentication token if successful.

## Events and Listeners Documentation
